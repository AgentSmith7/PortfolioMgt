# PortfolioMgt
This is the python code for QF623 Portfolio Management Project. 

Objective: In this project, we aim to build stylized long-short equity factor mimicking portfolios using different fundamental variables from Ken French’s data library and explore empirically their univariate efficacy over time and across different size segments. We then go on to build multi-factor strategies using alternative weighting schemes and compare them to the static equally weighted multi-factor strategy. Two alternative top-down factor weighting schemes will be considered: 1) Equal risk contribution across factors 2) Weighting based on factor persistence

Data: Attached with the project description are 6 csv files containing the monthly time series of value- and equal-weighted returns for portfolios formed on size and different fundamental variables consisting of book-to-price, cashflow-to-price, dividend yield, investment, profitability, prior 1-month return and 12-1 price momentum. In addition, there is a csv file named “F-F_Research_Data_Factors” which houses the Fama-French 3 factor model returns.

Programming language: Python
